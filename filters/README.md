# Filters

Filters allows you to filter out log records from your streams. A log record can
be filtered out from one stream but not another. Filters are processed after
monitors, but before transformers or stream handling. Upon handling a log
record, the logger will run filters once for each registered stream.

Some use cases for filters include:

- Preventing spam from filling up your logs
- Removing log records which contain illegal characters
- Blocking malicious log records

## Constructing a filter

There are two ways to construct a filter.

### Filter function

This is a good choice for short and simple filters. Filter functions must match
the following type:

```ts
export type FilterFn = (stream: Stream, logRecord: LogRecord) => boolean;
```

The function takes in a stream and logRecord and returns true if the logRecord
should be filtered out. Example:

```ts
const filter: FilterFn = (stream: Stream, logRecord: LogRecord) =>
  (logRecord.msg as string).includes("bad stuff");
```

### Implement the Filter interface

The Filter interface requires you to implement the `shouldFilterOut` function,
which is of type `FilterFn` as above. This gives you the power of a class for
more complex filtering, or perhaps you want to redirect filtered out logs to
another logger and stream.

```ts
class MyFilter implements Filter {
  shouldFilerOut(stream: Stream, logRecord: LogRecord): boolean {
    return (logRecord.msg as string).includes("bad stuff");
  }
}
```

## Registering your filter

Filters are registered directly with the logger as follows:

```ts
const myFilter = new MyFilter();
const logger = new Logger().addFilter(myFilter);
```

## Ready made filters

Two filters are available in Optic.

### Regular Expression Filter

This filter takes in a regular expression. If it matches, then the log record is
filtered out. The log record `msg` and `metadata` fields are first converted to
a string if necessary before testing the regular expression.

```ts
// Filters out log records containing `%` or `&` in the message or metadata
import { RegExpFilter } from "https://deno.land/x/optic/filters/regExpFilter.ts";

const regExpFilter = new RegExpFilter(/[%&]+/);
const logger = new Logger().addFilter(regExpFilter);
logger.error("Oh no!"); // not filtered
logger.error("Oh no!", "& another thing"); // filtered out
```

### Substring filter

This filter takes in a string. If this string is found to be a substring of
either the log record `msg` or `metadata` fields (converting them to string
first if required), then this log record is filtered out. Example:

```ts
import { SubStringFilter } from "https://deno.land/x/optic/filters/subStringFilter.ts";
import { Logger } from "https://deno.land/x/optic/mod.ts";

const subStringFilter = new SubStringFilter("user1234");
const logger = new Logger().addFilter(subStringFilter);
logger.info({ user: "joe1944", action: "login" }); // not filtered
logger.info({ user: "user1234", action: "login" }); // filtered out
```
